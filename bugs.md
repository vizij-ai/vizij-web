# Outstanding Node Graph Issues

- **Legacy clamp/remap specs need migration**: existing saved graphs (localStorage or persisted specs) still express `clamp` and `remap` bounds as node params. After the runtime changes those values are ignored unless they are presented as wired inputs, so loading an older graph silently reverts to zeroed ranges. Suggested fix: add a migration step when loading graphs that converts param-based min/max values into dedicated Constant nodes (or auto-generated default connections) before handing the spec to the wasm core, and strip the deprecated params afterward.
- **Variadic outputs lack pre-flight handles**: nodes such as `split` only surface their `partN` handles after evaluation, which makes it awkward to wire downstream nodes before the graph is running. Suggested fix: use registry `variadic_outputs` metadata (and sizes metadata where applicable) to synthesise a stable set of output handles up front, so wiring is possible even before live data is available.
